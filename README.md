# Employee Dataset (Generated using Python)

This repository contains a generated dataset of **100 unique employee records** using Python. Each employee has:

- A list of `experience`, each including:
  - Company ID
  - Designation
  - Salary
  - Skills used in that job

## Purpose

This dataset was created as part of a learning assignment for practicing:
- Data structures in Python (dictionaries and lists)
- Random data generation
- File handling (`.json` format)

## File

- `employee_data_100.json` â€” Contains the complete employee dataset

- Random selection of names, skills, and designations
- Two work experiences per employee
- Unique combination of employee and experience skills

## Usage

This dataset can be used for:
- Data science and machine learning practice
- JSON data manipulation exercises
- Building mock APIs or backend systems
